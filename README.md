# Midibox PCBs

## 8x0.96" OLEDs

Holds 8 0.96" OLED screens, spaced by 1.2" for a compact design.
J1 connects to J15A of the STM32F4 core.
J15_S should be set to 3.3V on the core, and JP1 to __Core__ on this PCB.

This PCB has an option to use external 3.3V power through J2.
In this case JP1 should be set to __Ext__.

Optional decoupling 100nF caps C1-C8 to improve noise rejection in case of flickering or other issues.

Only 4-wire SPI OLED types are supported

### Bill of materials

- 8 OLED screens
